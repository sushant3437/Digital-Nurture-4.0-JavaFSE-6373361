1. 🔍 What happens in the controller method?
When a request is made to /country, Spring maps it to the getCountryIndia() method.

Inside this method, we load country.xml using ApplicationContext and retrieve the bean with ID "country".

The bean is returned as a Java object (Country), but Spring automatically converts it to JSON using Jackson.

2. 🔁 How is the bean converted into JSON?
Spring Boot uses Jackson (included via spring-boot-starter-web) to serialize Java objects into JSON.

Since the Country class has proper getters, it is automatically converted into a JSON format in the HTTP response.
